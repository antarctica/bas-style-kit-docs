The Style Kit includes a number of global settings, styles and technologies designed to provide a consistent foundation.
{: .lead }

This minimises differences in experience between different browsers and operating systems, ensuring features such as
the layout grid work as expected.

Other technologies which are used in a global fashion, and which are described elsewhere, include:

* the [HTML5 document type]({{ '/start/standards-accessibility/#html5' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
* the [responsive meta tag]({{ '/start/standards-accessibility/#responsiveness-and-mobile-first' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Other styles which are used in a global fashion, and which are described elsewhere, include:

* the default [font size, family and line spacing]({{ '/core/typography/#typographic base' | prepend: site.baseurl }})

## Normalise.css
{: #{{ 'Normalise.css' | slugify }} }

{% include snippets/back-to-top.html %}

[Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) ensures browsers render all elements more consistently and in
line with modern standards.
