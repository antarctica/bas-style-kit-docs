## BAS Style Kit Testbed
{: #{{ 'Style Kit Testbed' | slugify }} }

{% include snippets/back-to-top.html %}

A separate resource is used for developing the BAS Style Kit, known as the Testbed. This contains a number of different
*samples* designed to test a specific part of the Style Kit in isolation.

This allows new features to be tested more easily, and prevents this documentation being misused as an enumeration of
all of the possible ways the Style Kit could be used - which would not be useful.

{% alert warning style=solid %}
The Testbed is not designed for end-users and does supplement or replace this documentation. It will include samples
which are intentionally designed not to work.
{% endalert %}

The testbed for the `master` branch of the BAS Style Kit can be found at:
