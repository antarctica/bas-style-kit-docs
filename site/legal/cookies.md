## How this website uses cookies

### Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)

We use Google Analytics [www.google.co.uk/analytics](https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/) to collect information about
how you use this website. We do this to make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make
improvements.

Google Analytics stores information about:

* the pages you visit on this website
* how long you spend on each page in this website
* how you came to this site (e.g. from a search engine or the main BAS website)
* what you click on while you are visiting the site (for example, whether you click links from the main navigation or
within pages)

**No personal information is collected or sent to this service (such as your name or email address).**

Google Analytics sets the following cookies:

| Name    | Purpose                                                                                                                                   | Expires                     |

| `_utma` | Like `_ga`, this lets us know if you have visited before, so we can count how many of our visitors are new or returning to a certain page | 2 years                     |
